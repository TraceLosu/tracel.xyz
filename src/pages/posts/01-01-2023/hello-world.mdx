title: Hello, world!
description: My first post on my website!

`Hello, world!` is a really overused phrase in the world of programming, but honestly I don't know what else to say for my first words in my website. But anyway, welcome to my website!

This place will be the spot for my thoughts in the ever expanding blackhole we call the internet. I never actually planned to make a blog. But, after I bought a domain, I came to the realization that I won't have anything on my root domain. So to fill that empty space, this blog site is made.

What you'll see in this site will most likely be garbled words that range from Overwatch 2 rants, to something pretty cool that I learned while programming. And since I am (about to be) an electrical engineer with an isatiable desire to learn web development, you'll also see me dabble in programming languanges other than what most frontend developers use, like Rust, C, and Python.

Currently, the website is very barren. I'll create another post about what I used, my process, and thoughts on creating this blog after I've finished adding all the features I planned, such as:
- View count
- Sharing feature
- Comment section
- More components such as twitter cards and code snippets

Hope you guys enjoy your stay, thank you!
